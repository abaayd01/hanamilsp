# HanamiLsp

This is a basic LSP for use with Hanami.

It makes assumptions about how you've laid out your project, based on Hanami conventions, to implement better 'go to definition' functionality for Hanami projects.

Use at your own risk! This was implemented to solve just a very specific problem I had, and _is not_ intended to be a fully featured LSP!
